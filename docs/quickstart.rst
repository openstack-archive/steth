===============================
Steth's developer documentation
===============================

Steth is an inspection tool that can aid in pinpointing issues before deployment
and during operation of an OpenStack environment.


-----------
Quick start
-----------

Steth is a network inspection tool for OpenStack.

It is modelled as agent(s)/client in which a controller interacts with
agents deployed in your environment. Let me introduce how to use steth.


-------------
Download code
-------------

Download the latest code from git repository. And run
``python setup.py install`` to install steth. After running that, you can
``steth --help`` to confirm Steth is installed correctly.


------------------
Deploy Steth Agent
------------------

Steth Agent listens in 0.0.0.0:9698 on any node you want. It will wait for
RPC request. Currently we support CentOS 6.5, CentOS 7.0 and CentOS 7.1 only.
In CentOS 6.5, you should run ``service steth-agent start`` to start
steth-agent. In CentOS 7.0 and 7.1, you should run ``systemctl start steth``
to start steth-agent.


-------------------
Deploy Steth Client
-------------------

Steth Client is a stateless program. You can run ``steth --help`` to show all
steth commands that you can run.


------------------
Configuration File
------------------

On start the client will read a configuration file. By default the configuration
file is located at ``/etc/steth/steth.conf``.

Here is an example of the configuration file

::

  # (ListOpt) list of networks types.
  # We may have multi network types in one node, such as mgmt, net and stroage.
  # so this value should be a list.
  # We seperate each item by ":". Treat first item as network type.
  # The second is physical nic name. And the third is network_prefix.
  # Example: "mgmt:eth0:1.1.1.,net:eth1:2.2.2.,storage:eth2:3.3.3."
  network_types=mgmt:eth0:1.1.1.,net:eth1:2.2.2.,storage:eth2:3.3.3.
 
  # (ListOpt) All nodes info. Just need sequence number.
  # Example: 64, 65, 66
  nodes_id=39,233,64,65,66

  # (StrOpt) Name prefix of every node. By default, this value
  # is "server". We combine "node_name_prefix" with
  # "nodes_id", to define nodes. Such as "server-64", "server-68"
  # and so on. In every region, we give every node a specific name.
  # Ensure that DNS can resolve the nodes.
  node_name_prefix=server-
