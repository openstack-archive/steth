# (ListOpt) list of networks types.
# We may have multi network types in one node, such as mgmt, net and stroage.
# so this value should be a list.
# We seperate each item by ":". Treat first item as network type.
# The second is physical nic name. And the third is network_prefix.
# Example: "mgmt:eth0:1.1.1.,net:eth1:2.2.2.,storage:eth2:3.3.3."
network_types=mgmt:eth0:1.1.1.,net:eth1:2.2.2.,storage:eth2:3.3.3.

# (ListOpt) All nodes info. Just need sequence number.
# Example: 64, 65, 66
nodes_id=39,233,64,65,66

# (StrOpt) Name prefix of every node. By default, this value
# is "server". We combine "node_name_prefix" with
# "nodes_id", to define nodes. Such as "server-64", "server-68"
# and so on. In every region, we give every node a specific name.
# Ensure that DNS can resolve the nodes.
